Hello, my name is Ethan He, I am a fullstack web developer from the United States. I have a bachelor degree in Business Marketing and have been coding part time for about half year now. Right now I am working for a  financial firm, and wish to become a full-time web developer. So far I know Ruby on Rails, html5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, BootStrap, and WordPress.
I am passionate about coding and online marketing, so I wish to combine my coding skills and my marketing background to create highly dynamic and interactive websites in the future!
